The goal in this game is to scores

The game consists of taping on the screen

Hexagon rotates with every touch

If you click on the right side of the screen, it will rotate to the right, if you click left, it will rotate to the left.

In order to score points, our ball must touch a corner of its own color

If our ball touches a corner of its own color, its color changes

If it touches the wrong color the game is over
